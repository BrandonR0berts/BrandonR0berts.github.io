								<h4>
									<h2><b>Introduction:</b></h2>
								</h4>
								
								<p>
									For a module of my second semester of university, we were tasked with creating a 3D game or scene using OpenGL and GLUT. For my submission I decided to create a 3D game in which you sail a boat around and collect extra time my running into buoys floating on the water's surface. </br> 
									This project ended up involving some complex coding concepts, but didn't turn out looking particularly good. 
								</p>
								
								<h4>
									<h2><b>Modern OpenGL and Project Setup:</b></h2>
								</h4>
								
								<p>
									For this project I decided to use modern OpenGL techniques in order to render the objects in the level. This involved using custom written shaders and additional libraries such as GLFW (Graphics Library Framework) and GLM (OpenGL Maths). </br>
									These shaders ended up taking a lot of the time I had to create the project, resulting in less elements being in the final solution than initially planned. However, through developing this program my knowledge of shaders, and OpenGL in general, has improved a lot.
								</p>
								
								<h4>
									<h2><b>Heightmaps:</b></h2>
								</h4>
								
								<p>
									The water's surface and surroundings were made through using heightmaps. This was to allow for the water's surface to be constantly changing, and for the surroundings to be loading in from an image. </br>
									When rendering the surroundings heightmap I used colour boundings in order to render it in a cartoonish way. I also used non-smoothed colouring in the fragment shader so that the effect would render as intended. </br>
									
								</p>
								
								<h4>
									<h2><b>Playable Boat:</b></h2>
								</h4>
								
								<p>
									The gameplay of the project is having the player have a 3rd person control of the boat, moving the camera whilst pressing the right mouse button and moving the mouse around. </br>
									The boat's movement is based around having boat constantly moving in its forward direction, at its current velocity, and having it rotate its forward left and right when the player presses 'A' and 'D'. </br>
									This control scheme gives a greater impression of being on a boat than having traditional 'WASD' controls, with each moving the boat in a direction.
