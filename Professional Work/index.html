							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/Crk5be9rgP4">Lost My Marbles</a></h2>
							<p>
								My first professionally developed project, developed while working for Curioso Games in the summer between my first and second year of A-Levels. 
							</p>
						</header>                                                                                                                                                                                                 
						<p>
							This game was my first professionally developed project, and as such I learnt a lot about the professional programming standards, along with how teams and larger projects are managed from a deadline and feedback perspective. Along with how different areas of game development work together to work towards a completed project.</br> </br>
					                The main area I developed for this project was the opponent AI. The game uses an internal ranking score which ranges from zero to around ten. 
							As the player plays and wins more they will level up, which means that the AI opponent's difficulty needs to scale with the player's level - ensuring that the player continually finds the game fun, yet challenging. </br> </br>
							For the AI I went with a determanistic approach which scans through the entire board and calculates the best possible marble placement with the marble colour combinations that they have avaliable.
			                                It then, from that initial data, determines the best movement required to get the marbles into that position. For example, if the best possible position was the position at the bottom of the column that the marbles are currently on, but in the other rotation, then the AI would determine that rotating the marbles' order to be the best possible move.
			                                After finding this move then, with the probability scaled according to the ranking of the opponent, a random number is chosen. If this number falls within the scaled distance then a random move is selected instead of the best possible move. (This bit actually runs first for performance reasons)
							This element of randomness makes the lower level opponenets more human, and easier to play against, yet for much better opponents at higher rankings the randomness does not have any affect due to the scaled value cutoff. </br> </br>
							The main difficulty with making the AI algorithm was having it handle impossible move situations, such as when the best possible move is on the far side of a high pillar of marbles. To avoid these situations all impossible columns are removed from the calulations prior to calculating the best possible move. </br> </br>
							Beyond the AI, I learnt a lot about the game engine of Unity as a whole, and more specifically a lot more about the language of C#.

							<p>
								My second professionally developed game. Developed immediatly after Lost My Marbles, during my time working for Curioso Games in 2019.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Having just finished working on the development of Lost My Marbles, I was already up to speed with how the team was managed, along with the version control that was in place at the time. 
							Therefore, my experience of the development of this project was a lot more focused on the code side of development, rather than becoming familular with teamworking in a professional enviroment. </br> </br>
							For the Rituals project, one of the main areas I developed was the level traversing 'Pin' system. This system is used to allow the player to enter worlds as well as individual levels, but was developed with design usage specifically in mind. 
							This system works mainly through the transfering of relevent data stored internally about the levels, such as the level type, enemy health, moves allowed to beat the level, etc, to the level scene that is to be loaded into. 
							The main consideration of the system was to make it as easy as possible to have designers tweek level values without having to touch any game code, allowing for easier game balancing and level ordering than without this system.</br>

							<h2><a href="https://player-two.itch.io/rise-of-the-spitfire">Rise Of The Spitfire</a></h2>
							<p>
								After winning the 'Stoke On Trend' game jam, we continued working on the game to convert the prototype into a fully complete publishable game. 
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							This game intially started as a week long game jam project at the end of my first year of University. The jam was organised by the University, with the themes all being based on the Stoke On-Trent area.
							For example some themes were: Spitfire, Blue Clock, Sir Stanley Matthews, etc. </br> </br>
							Our theme was 'Spitfire', which we initially brainstormed around and came up with a game idea that was a blend of the flying levels in 'Cuphead', and the plane style in '1942'.
							What resulted from this was an infinitally playable, side scrolling twin stick shooter set in world war 2. This project won the overall game jam and so we were invited to spend 6 weeks throughout our summer to turn it into a commercially releasable game. </br> </br>
							After bringing on another programmer, as only one programmer for two designers, for 6 weeks work would have been unsustainable, we began work on the project. Untimatly turning it from an infinitely playable, randomly generating game, to a level based one, with level bosses at the end of each level, and a variety of different enemy flight patterns.
							Furthermore we added powerups to the game, spicing the gameplay up from the original project in a few ways. In addition to this, the artists produced new level backgroud artwork, which gave the game a different feel based on what level you are in.
							Due to the team not having audio producer, all of the music and sound effects are from a humble bundle that allow for commercial products to be created from the assest. </br> </br>
							The main areas that I worked on were the level spawning system, with the boss triggers, the level designs, the power-ups, the background art scrolling system and enemy movement controls.
							This project was also developed within Unity, using C#, as developing the same game within pure C++ would have taken too much time for the 6-week deadline imposed.
