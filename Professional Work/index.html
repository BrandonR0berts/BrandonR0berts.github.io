							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/Crk5be9rgP4">Lost My Marbles</a></h2>
							<p>
								My first professionally developed project, developed while working for Curioso Games in the summer between my first and second year of A-Levels. 
							</p>
						</header>                                                                                                                                                                                                 
						<p>
							As this was my first project developed professionally I learnt a lot about not just about the programming of professionaly developed games, but also about how teams and larger projects are managed. </br>
					                The main area I developed for this project was the opponent AI. The game uses an internal ranking score which ranges from zero all the way up to around about 10. 
							As the player plays and wins more they will level up, which means that the AI needs to be playing better at higher levels, and worse at lower levels - so the player continually finds the game fun. </br>
							For the AI I went with a determanistic approach, one which scans through the entire board and calculates the best possible marble placement with the marble colours that they currently have.
			                                It then, from that positional data, determines the best movement required to get the marbles into that position. For example, if the best possible position was the position at the bottom of the column that the marbles are currently on, but in the other rotation, then the AI would determine that rotating the marbles is the best possible move.
			                                Then, with the probability scaled due to the ranking of the opponent, a random number is chosen. If this number falls within the scaled distance then a random move is selected instead of the best possible move. (This bit actually runs first for performance reasons)
							This then therefore gives much better opponents at higher rankings, where around about 2 ranks from the top the randomness does not have any affect. </br>
							The main difficulty with the AI algorithm was having it handle impossible move situations, such as the best possible move being on the far side of a really high pillar of marbles. In these situations all impossible columns are removed from the calulations. </br>
							Beyond the AI, I learnt a lot about the game engine of Unity as a whole, and more specifically a lot more about the language of C#.

							<p>
								My second professionally developed game. Developed immediatly after Lost My Marbles, during my time working for Curioso Games in 2019.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Having just finished working on the development of Lost My Marbles, I was already up to speed with how the team was managed, along with the version control that was in place at the time. 
							Therefore, my experince of the development of this project was a lot more focused on the code side of development. </br>
							In the Rituals project, one of the main areas I developed was the level traversing 'Pin' system. This system is used to allow the player to enter worlds as well as individual levels. 
							It works mainly through the transfering of relevent data stored internally about the levels, such as the level type, enemy health, moves allowed to beat the level, to the level scene that is to be loaded. 
							A further consideration of the system was to make it as easy as possible to have the designers tweek level values without having to touch any game code, allowing for easier game balancing.</br>

							<h2><a href="https://player-two.itch.io/rise-of-the-spitfire">Rise Of The Spitfire</a></h2>
							<p>
								After winning the 'Stoke On Trend' game jam, we were invited to continue working on the game and convert the prototype into a fully complete released game. 
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							This project intially started as a week long game jam project at the end of my first year of university. The jam was organised by the university, with the themes all being based on the Stoke On-Trent area.
							For example some themes were: Spitfire, Blue Clock, Sir Stanley Matthews, etc. </br>
							Our theme was 'Spitfire', which we initially brainstormed around and came up with a game idea that was a blend of the flying levels in 'Cuphead', and the plane style in '1942'.
							What resulted from this was an infinitally playable, side scrolling twin stick shooter set in world war 2. This project won the overall game jam and so we were invited to spend 6 weeks throughout our summer to turn it into a commercially releasable game. </br>
							After bringing on another programmer, as only one programmer for 6 weeks work would have been unsustainable, we began work on the project. Untimatly turning it from an infinitely playable game into a level based game, with level bosses at the end of each level, and a variety of different enemy flight patterns.
							Furthermore we added powerups to the game, spicing the gameplay up from the original project. In addition to this, the artists produced new level backgroud artwork, which gave the game a different feel based on what level you are in.
							All of the music and sound effects are from a humble bundle, as we didnt have an audio producer.
							The areas that I worked on solely were the level spawning system, with the boss triggers, the level designs, the power-ups, the background art scrolling system and enemy movement controls.
							This project was also developed within Unity, using C#, as developing the same game within pure C++ would have taken too much time for the 6-week deadline.
