								An Invesigation into Simulating Large Bodies of Water in Computer Games 
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Part of my final year we were assigned the task of completing a dissertation with practical artefact portion. This disseration needed to be heavily researched and justified through academic literature, as well as through practical evidience from the games industry. </br>
							The area I decided to research into was the realm of realistic water simulation, originally aiming for both surface modelling and rendering, however each area was large enough to justify its own dissertation, so I decided to focus on just surface modelling. </br>
							After devling into many academic papers and professional talks, through platforms such as SIIGRAPH and GDC, I came across a paper by Jerry Tessendorf detailing how to efficiently simulate realisic ocean waves using inverse FFT calculations. This is also the approach that Sea of Thieves uses for their water siulation. </br>
							Expanding from this literature collection I began work on an artefact which aimed to replicate the Tessendorf approach, as well as two simpler, less expensive approahces to simulating water - these being summing sine waves, and Gerstner waves. The artefact is avaliable on my github through the link below.

								Final Year Group engine Creation Project
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							For the final module in my games programming degree I worked with a group of other students, all under the supervision of an industry mentor, to create a 2D game engine from scratch. </br>
							My role within the team was to create and manage the rendering side of the engine, incorporating any changes to the level format and effects that were to be made. What I ended up developing for the project was an instanced 2D rendering framework built using OpenGL 4.3.
							On top of the rendering portion of the engine I added an internal event triggering system, input handling, memory management, particle systems, screenshots, shadowing, and basic UI functionality. </br>
							The final product we produced was an engine in which you could easily make a 2D level based game, with multiple layers and effects with ease.

							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/x4cHpkMS2IA">Super Mario Bros 3</a></h2>
							<p>
								Developed using SDL2 in C++ for a first year game development task.  
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							As a submission for my second semester game development module we were tasked with following tutorials on creating the one screen arcade Mario Bros game. 
							These tutorials explained the process of setting up SDL2, as well as the basics of object orientated programming in C++. </br>
							I completed these tutorials fairly quickly, so as an extension to this task I decided to expand on the game to include the first world map, and first level of SNES game, Super Mario Bros 3. </br> </br>
							This decision stemmed from me having a fair amount of prior programming experience, and the determination to re-create as much of the original game as I could within the time frame of the semester. </br> </br>
							Overall, the visuals and controls for the first world, and the first level were able to be created in the short time frame I has avaliable, as is shown in the video link below.</br>
							The main difficulties I found with this project came from a combination of it being one of my first large scale solo projects undertaken, and the sheer amount of objects, items and systems requred to be put in place to accomidate everything. 
							So, in the final submission, the systems to support any number of levels; having any level be any width, height or use any sprite sheet; having very little work required to add new blocks and enemy types and much more was included. </br>
							However, one of my regrets from this project was not making a level editor. As this forced me to type out all of the individual level data files by hand. Which untimatly caused the biggest bottleneck to the development process.

							<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/C2QQ_cojnxg">Pacman</a></h2>
							<p>
								Re-creation of the iconic arcade game of Pacman, with a variety of level graphics and fully AI ghosts to run from.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							Through the first semester of the first year we were tasked, as part of a games and graphics fundamentals module, with re-creating the arcade game Pacman as well as we could. </br> </br>
							Initially I just worked the basic elements of the game, these being the maze collision, player and ghost movement, level switching when the level is complete, and the pellet spawning systems. This was in an attempt to get the basic required elements of the project complete to free up time later on for more complex additions. </br> </br>
							After completing the basics of the project with a fair amount of time remaining till submission, I decided look into how to add AI to the ghosts that chase the player around the level. </br> </br>
							Prior to this I had not written any complete AI systems, only the opponent player in 'Marbles', so I first researched ways of going about the task and decided to go with a stack-based finate state machine. </br> </br>
							This approach ended up working very well, and I was inspired to add another gamemode to the game, as I sill had some time left at this point. This other gamemode was to have the player to play as one of the ghosts, working in tandem with the other (AI) ghosts to chase down an AI controlled Pacman. </br>
							This other gamemode ended up being more complex to implement than I had initially anticipated, but after a long while of bug fixing and tweaking to the AI system, the gamemode was complete and playable. </br> </br>
							All of the gamemodes are demonstrated in the video link below.

							<h2><a href="#">OpenGL Boat Project</a></h2>
							<p>
								First year submission for an OpenGL module that was inspired by sailing a boat around a lake.  
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>
							For the second semester we had a module teaching the basics of the fixed function pipeline of OpenGL. 
							Through this module we learnt the basics of the graphics pipeline, rendering objects to the screen, and texturing them. However, during this time I was looking into how to work with shaders within the more modern versions of OpenGL.
							And, therefore, I decided to work on a submission that used shaders entirely written by me. This was partly to hit the 'advanced' section of the mark scheme, but it was mainly as an opportunity to put some of the research I had condcted into practice in a time limited task.
							Overall the visuals of the submission were not great, but everything demonstrated in the project was handwritten by me and is running using custom OpenGL shaders.
